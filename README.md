The project was developed using Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) version 6.5.0 and utilizes a script written in Batch (Windows) / Bash (Linux). Its purpose is to generate a quasi-geoid and contour lines based on input data, as well as to visualize the results in the form of raster maps with applied shading and a color palette.The script can be used for altimetric and geoid analysis, supporting geodetic and cartographic studies, as well as terrain modeling based on quasi-geoid data. By automating data processing, it enables the quick generation of maps with value interpolation and contour line visualization. An example of a generated map using this script is shown below.
